# Horiseon 

## About 
This Horiseon webpage was built to optimize brand awareness while formally acting as the homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. The starter code was edited to follow accesibility standards and increase search engine optimization.

## Changes to the Starter Code
- Semantic HTML Elements - The sourcecode was changed to include semantic HTML elements as opposed to non-semantic elements 
- Logical HTML and CSS structure - Several elements were out of place in the CSS sourcecode so these elements were edited and placed in a logical order
- Alt attributes - Images in the sourcecode were missing alt attributes; alt attributes were therefore added where appropriate
- Heading Attributes in Sequential Order - The last heading attribute was not in sequential order but was edited to follow the order
- Descriptive Title - A title was missing so the "Horiseon" title was added to the sourcecode
- SEO Link - The SEO jump link was not functioning properly so the element was edited to work correctly
